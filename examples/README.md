# Examples

There's a quick recording which contains two transmissions with different values, and a GRC flow graph which will decode the transmissions. The decoding is not perfect, so you'll see some messages that can't be decoded, and how the block deals with them.

The Protocol value that will decode these transmissions is 

`ignore.11 label.deviceid int.12 ignore.1 label.value1 int.15 ignore.1 label.value2 int.15 ignore.1 label.value3 int.15`
